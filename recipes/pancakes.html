    <p>Pancakes are a popular breakfast dish made from a batter of flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder, cooked on a griddle or frying pan.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the milk, egg, and melted butter until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; some lumps are okay.</li>

        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the hot griddle for each pancake.</li>

        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with maple syrup or your favorite toppings.</li>

    <p>Remember to store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</p>
    <p>Reheat pancakes in a toaster or microwave before serving.</p>
